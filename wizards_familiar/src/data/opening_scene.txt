A week ago you received a strange violet envelope in the mail.

...

Inside was a letter from the Great Wizard Mordecai. But you're used to calling him grandfather.

....

It seems he has passed away.

.....

Now, after a long drive through the countryside you arrive at his estate.
Rain pours down around you as you make your way up to the gargantuan doubledoors.
You place the elaborately decorated key in the lock, which opens with a "click!"
Gripping the letter tightly, you enter your grandfather's home for the first time in 15 years.
