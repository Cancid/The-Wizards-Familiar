Dear Willow,
    
    I know it has been quite some time since we have spoken, but I need your help. 
    If you have received this letter, then I have passed away.
    Please, do not remorse. I lived far longer than most, but magic can only keep one alive for so long.

    However, it is my familiar, the faedragon Callidopie that I am worried about.
    Without me, she has no way of returning home to the Feywild!
    She has been an excellent familiar and an even better friend. She deserves to go home.

    If you would, please go to my home and find my spellbook. Inside you will find
    the instructions to perform the Planeshift spell and send Callidopie home.
    Take heed! Calidopie is very shy. In order to get her to the ritual chamber,
    you MUST make her a tasty treat! 
    If you do this for me, and for Calidopie, we will both be eternally grateful.

    I know that you never really knew your kooky grandfather Mordecai and for that I regret. 
    I wish I got to know you better before I passed.

    Thank you Willow,
    You will make a true wizard yet!

Love, 
Grandpa
The Great Wizard Mordecai
